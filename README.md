## Considerations ##
This bot was made just for fun, I just did it to learn basics of Telegram bot API. I have it running on my Raspberry Pi. If you use this bot and it gets so popular that many people use it, please consider limitations of the API.

From [Telegram web](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this).
> **My bot is hitting limits, how do I avoid this?**
> 
> When sending messages inside a particular chat, avoid sending more than one message per second. We may allow short bursts that go over this limit, but eventually you'll begin receiving 429 errors.
> 
> If you're sending bulk notifications to multiple users, the API will not allow more than 30 messages per second or so. Consider spreading out notifications over large intervals of 8â€”12 hours for best results.
> 
> Also note that your bot will not be able to send more than 20 messages per minute to the same group.

> **How can I message all of my bot's subscribers at once?**
> 
> Unfortunately, at this moment we don't have methods for sending bulk messages, e.g. notifications. We may add something along these lines in the future.
> 
> In order to avoid hitting our limits when sending out mass notifications, consider spreading them over longer intervals, e.g. 8-12 hours. The API will not allow more than ~30 messages to different users per second, if you go over that, you'll start getting 429 errors.

From [OpenWeatherMap web](https://openweathermap.org/price), free plan allows **60 calls per minute**.
